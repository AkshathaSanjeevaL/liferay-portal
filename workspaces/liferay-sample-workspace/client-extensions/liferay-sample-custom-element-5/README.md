# liferay-sample-custom-element-5

This sample shows a simple Custom Element that shares the `@clayui/badge`
package from the instance DXP is making publicly available through an import
map.

It also pulls `react` and `react-dom` using the same mechanism (because Clay is
based on React and needs it), even though it's not the main goal of the example.
